# RouterForge changelog

RouterForge components are versioned independently. Entries below describe platform milestones; they are not a promise that every package shares the same version.

## [Unreleased]

## 2026-09-07 — RouterForge 0.6.0

### Stable highlights

- RouterForge Core advances to `0.6.0` after the `0.6.0-beta.4` ARM64 hardware validation pass; the product Stable snapshot is `0.6.0`.
- Home is now a unified, path-aware Attention Center with device identity, channel/Core state, uptime, telemetry, default-route detection, sustained CPU detection, and actionable warning/critical counting.
- App Center replaces the old user-facing Marketplace surface and combines official RouterForge packages, curated integrations, generic Entware/OPKG, async lifecycle jobs, history, and update aggregation.
- Fresh Stable 0.6 bootstrap is Core-only. DNS, monitoring, control, profiling, and integrations are selected afterwards from App Center; already-installed optional packages are preserved.
- Core self-update is restart-safe, stale refresh races are generation-guarded, startup loading is distinct from confirmed outage, and fast telemetry publishes without waiting for slower supplemental providers.
- App Center metadata presentation and RU/EN localization were hardened during the final Beta hardware pass.
- Stable 0.6 publishes ARM64 plus MIPS/MipSel target packages. ARM64 is hardware validated; MIPS/MipSel remain experimental, require explicit opt-in/runtime probing, and are clearly marked as not tested on physical hardware.

### 2026-09-07 — RouterForge 0.6.0-beta.4 App Center self-update/i18n hotfix

- Product snapshot advances to `0.6.0-beta.4`; Core advances from `0.6.0-beta.2` to `0.6.0-beta.3` because the embedded App Center frontend changed again.
- Core self-update treats a transport-only disconnect during Core restart as expected, then waits for `/api/catalog` to recover and verifies that the installed Core version matches the requested target before reporting success.
- App Center hides unavailable optional package metadata instead of rendering rows full of dashes; status-bearing fields use localized semantic text.
- Service metadata is rendered only for Core or entries with a declared service contract, avoiding meaningless empty Service rows for RouterForge DNS.
- App Center technical labels, action states, preflight/Entware metadata, and official RouterForge module descriptions now have explicit RU/EN copy.

### 2026-09-07 — RouterForge 0.6.0-beta.3 refresh/bootstrap hotfix

- Product snapshot advances to `0.6.0-beta.3`; Core advances from `0.6.0-beta.1` to `0.6.0-beta.2` because the Core frontend/store startup path changed again.
- Home attention state now recomputes from explicit reactive dependencies instead of retaining the initial false offline snapshot.
- Initial Core/App Center loading is distinct from a confirmed outage, eliminating false red/yellow startup alerts during normal page refresh.
- Catalog hydration triggers telemetry refresh immediately instead of waiting for the next 10-second overview poll.
- Overview refreshes are generation-guarded, fast telemetry providers run concurrently, and CPU/RAM/thermal/storage can publish before slower DNS/network/action-history calls finish.
- SSE reconnect validates the HTTP fallback before declaring Core offline.

### 2026-09-07 — RouterForge 0.6.0-beta.2 release-candidate hotfix

- Product snapshot advances to `0.6.0-beta.2` because the immutable `routerforge-v0.6.0-beta.1` release already exists and cannot be overwritten.
- Core advances from `0.6.0-beta` to `0.6.0-beta.1` because the Core frontend itself changed and must produce a new deployable IPK; other component versions remain unchanged.
- Home no longer reports RouterForge DNS as a stopped service when the installed module has no declared service contract.
- The attention badge counts only warning/critical events; informational update rows remain visible without inflating the problem count.
- App Center action history is collapsible and its row/header spacing is cleaned up.
- App Center module cards wrap long metadata/compatibility values instead of letting labels and values overlap.

### 2026-09-07 — RouterForge 0.6.0-beta.1 preparation

- Core `0.6.0-beta` redesigns Home into a path-aware attention center with device identity/uptime, sidebar telemetry, approved CPU/RAM/thermal/storage thresholds, sustained CPU detection, default-route alerting and recent failed App Center action visibility.
- App Center closes the Phase 5 OPKG contract: cached read paths, package detail/preflight, dependencies/sizes, guarded async non-Core actions with SSE/cancel/global lock/timeout/history/post-verify, while Core self-update keeps a separate restart-safe lifecycle.
- DNS attention follows the effective resolver path: active secure upstream health/quality/fallback/local-path diagnostics plus recent plain UDP/TCP terminal events, avoiding noise from unused backup resolvers.
- RouterForge release metadata now carries architecture, download/installed size, dependencies and conflicts; release-index remains authoritative while `Packages`/`Packages.gz` stays a parallel OPKG view.
- Manifest schema adds `version_source`, `conflicts` and typed `web` metadata as groundwork only; the Phase 6 embedded workspace and request-token hardening remain a separate security gate.
- Fresh 0.6 Beta bootstrap installs Core only. Optional RouterForge modules, integrations and Entware packages are selected afterwards from App Center.
- Device model detection now falls back to cached `ndmc -c "show version"` parsing when device-tree/tmp model sources are insufficient.
- MIPS/MipSel remain Beta experimental preview targets without physical hardware validation; Stable stays blocked for them.


- DNS `0.4.19` fixes plain-DNS mutation readback failures on Keenetic: targeted RCI `DELETE /ip/name-server` removes only the intended physical resolver instead of clearing/reposting the entire static list; strict snapshot/save/readback/rollback verification remains enabled, and nested NDMS application errors returned with HTTP 200 are now detected instead of being mistaken for success.
- Repository sources are organized by component ownership: Core and Control live under `components/`, DNS owns runtime/frontend/packaging under `modules/dns/`, monitoring package lifecycle lives with each public module, and release manifests live under `release/channels/`. Runtime/package versions are unchanged.
- The historical root Marketplace Registry URL remains stable for older Core compatibility; CI keeps the Core embedded Registry mirror byte-identical.

## 2026-09-05 — RouterForge Core 0.4.3 / DNS 0.4.18

### Stable highlights

- Core 0.4.3 makes Marketplace package accounting match real `opkg` state and rejects false-success updates whose installed version does not match the target release.
- Core 0.4.2 lifecycle work is included: Module ABI install/update/restart distinguishes package-installed from runtime-ready, uses readiness probes, and reconnects module UI without exposing raw proxy JSON.
- DNS 0.4.18 includes the readiness-aware maintainer lifecycle plus the 0.4.14–0.4.17 resolver/theme/diagnostics fixes validated in Beta.
- DNS 0.4.18 requires Core 0.4.2 or newer.

### Included beta history

- Core `0.4.3-beta` fixes package-version accounting after real opkg upgrades:
  - opkg status parsing now accepts only stanzas whose package state is actually `installed`, so stale `not-installed` tombstones cannot overwrite the live version shown by Marketplace;
  - RouterForge release updates now verify the catalog-reported installed version against the target release before returning success.
- Core `0.4.2-beta` fixes Module ABI upgrade lifecycle races:
  - module proxy now reports package-installed state independently from runtime socket availability;
  - module UI dial failures return a no-store reconnect page instead of raw JSON, while normal API failures remain JSON 503;
  - ModuleFrame performs health preflight, distinguishes not-installed from restarting, and retries until runtime is ready;
  - authenticated installations keep API protection intact while allowing only loopback GET/HEAD module-health probes for package readiness checks.
- DNS `0.4.18-beta` makes Module ABI upgrades readiness-aware:
  - maintainer script no longer hides DNS start failures;
  - postinst waits for proxied module health before reporting success and emits log/socket diagnostics on timeout;
  - beta DNS now requires Core `0.4.2-beta`.

- DNS `0.4.17-beta` fixes the remaining unthemed Resolvers 2.0 detail strip:
  - resolver detail metric values now use the active custom theme text token;
  - metric captions now use the custom muted token;
  - the runtime status strip now uses custom surface/border/muted tokens instead of the old Forge hard-coded gray palette.
- DNS `0.4.16-beta` completes custom-theme state parity for the Traffic and Diagnostics second-level navigation:
  - active Traffic/Diagnostics subtabs use the current accent only on text/underline and never receive a full accent fill;
  - mouse-click focus no longer leaves a browser-default white rectangle around a selected subtab; keyboard focus remains visible through a semantic accent focus ring;
  - Diagnostics report/action buttons now consume RouterForge surface, border, muted/text and hover tokens;
  - active filter buttons (for example ALL/SERVFAIL/TIMEOUT) now use the configured accent instead of the old hard-coded green state.
- DNS `0.4.15-beta` polishes custom-theme interactive states after live visual validation:
  - inactive segmented controls now use the current theme's muted/text palette instead of stale Forge-era hard-coded colors;
  - selected segmented controls keep the user accent on text/selection edge without an alert-like full accent wash;
  - the selected resolver in Resolvers 2.0 keeps an accent selection edge but uses the normal hover surface instead of tinting the whole row;
  - browser-default focus outlines on DNS top tabs are replaced by an accessible theme-aware focus ring;
  - DoT/DoH capacity pills are neutral informational controls and only switch to warning styling when their independent 8-entry pool is full.
- DNS `0.4.14-beta` hotfixes three issues found immediately after the 0.4.13 stable rollout:
  - DoT and DoH capacity are separate Keenetic pools: RouterForge now allows up to 8 physical DoT entries **and** up to 8 physical DoH entries, exposes both limits independently, and projects each pool separately in the resolver editor. The production configuration with 8 DoT plus a simultaneous DoH entry proves the previous shared-8 guard was too strict; the earlier Hopper test had only proven the 8-entry DoT pool because RouterForge preflight blocked the mixed ninth entry before NDMS was actually exercised.
  - Module ABI DNS now inherits the full live RouterForge semantic theme (custom background/text/accent, density and radius) instead of only a subset of legacy shell tokens; a parent-root MutationObserver keeps the iframe synchronized with appearance changes.
  - Diagnostics no longer uses non-unique Svelte keys derived from resolver display names for error bursts/journal rows. Native multi-domain resolvers can legitimately share those names, which could throw a duplicate-key runtime error and freeze the DNS module until reload; the journal is also capped at 500 rendered rows.
## 2026-09-04 — RouterForge Core 0.4.1 / DNS 0.4.13

### Stable highlights

- DNS is now a full Module ABI v1 runtime with its own backend/API/UI; Core provides the shared shell, authentication, Marketplace/Registry and generic module host.
- DNS Control manages plain DNS, DoT and DoH with Add/Edit/Delete, temporary Disable/Enable, dynamic-entry read-only protection and logical multi-domain grouping.
- Live Hopper validation confirmed structured Keenetic RCI writes, DoT `fqdn`/SNI handling, DoH `url` write semantics, stable DoH logical IDs, the 8-entry DoT pool, the 16-domain plain-DNS limit and exact rollback/readback restoration. Separate DoH capacity was corrected after the 0.4.13 rollout; see DNS 0.4.14-beta above.
- Observability parity is restored across Overview, Rules, Traffic and Diagnostics: history, DNS Flow, client drill-down, interfaces, domains/QTYPEs, fallback routes, error bursts, runtime health and system details.
- Resolvers 2.0 combines the original master/detail UX with the validated DNS Control feature set and keeps an optional equalized Cards view.
- The DNS iframe now follows real module content height and Core visual scaling, eliminating nested scrolling and keeping the module visually aligned with the RouterForge shell.

### Included 0.4 development history

- DNS `0.4.13-beta` introduces Resolvers 2.0, combining the original master/detail server UX with the validated Module ABI DNS Control feature set:
  - the default resolver view is a stable master list plus selected-resolver detail pane with CRUD/Disable/Enable, dynamic read-only protection, logical/native metadata and persistent selection across refreshes;
  - logical DNS/DoT/DoH resolvers are correlated with existing runtime telemetry; multi-domain secure resolvers aggregate their native entries into 5m/1h/24h quality, diagnostics and recent-flow views;
  - plain DNS details reuse the passive resolver tracker, while DoT/DoH details restore quality windows, health probe stages, runtime ports and discovery metadata;
  - an optional Cards view preserves the newer DNS Control presentation with equalized card geometry, bounded endpoints and a direct Details action back into the master/detail view;
  - search/protocol/status filters, 8-slot secure preflight, 16-domain plain-DNS guard and snapshot/readback/rollback mutation semantics are unchanged.
- DNS `0.4.12-beta` polishes the restored Module ABI DNS layout without changing resolver control:
  - the same-origin DNS iframe now follows the module's real content height (with a viewport floor), eliminating the unnecessary nested vertical scrollbar and letting the Core page/browser own scrolling;
  - iframe height follows tab/content changes via ResizeObserver and parent/window resize events;
  - the oversized standalone Native mode panel on Resolvers is replaced by a compact readback/rollback safety note while the native multi-entry explanation remains in the resolver panel header.
- DNS `0.4.11-beta` restores the observability/control UI parity that was lost during the Module ABI v1 split without moving DNS back into Core:
  - Overview again shows searchable active/all runtime tables for plain DNS and protected DoT/DoH, including health, latency, errors, fallback, quality and Keenetic policy contexts;
  - Rules keeps the new native domain-binding view and restores observed fallback routes, Keenetic profile summaries, local records and rebind state;
  - Traffic restores history windows, live DNS Flow with pause/filtering, per-device drill-down, interfaces, domains/QTYPEs and plain-DNS recent events;
  - Diagnostics restores error bursts/journal, local proxy connections, runtime DNS health diagnostics and process/system details;
  - the module reuses the existing Module ABI endpoints (history, fallbacks, clients, client, interfaces, system, error-bursts and plain-dns), refreshes view-specific data lazily, and leaves the already validated resolver mutation/rollback backend untouched.

- DNS `0.4.10-beta` fixes DoH logical-ID stability after successful native writes:
  - Keenetic DoH readback exposes the HTTPS endpoint but no separate port field; RouterForge now reconstructs port 443 (or a custom port embedded in the URL) before calculating resolver identity;
  - this keeps the ID returned by `Create` identical to the ID reconstructed by the next `loadState`, so immediate PATCH/Disable/Enable/Delete operations no longer return a false 404;
  - regression tests cover default HTTPS port 443 and a custom URL port.
- DNS `0.4.9-beta` fixes Keenetic DoH native writes after live Hopper readback validation:
  - DoH write payloads now use Keenetic's `url` RCI argument while readback continues to accept the saved/runtime `uri` shape; posting `uri` was transport-valid but NDMS silently discarded the upstream;
  - canonical verification treats `url` and `uri` as the same DoH endpoint, so write/readback semantics match the firmware;
  - documented DoH SPKI support is preserved through normalization, native entry generation, RCI writes and the resolver editor.
- DNS `0.4.8-beta` fixes the DNS overview runtime regression introduced by the secure DoT/DoH capacity rename:
  - the overview cache metric still referenced the removed `dotSlotLimit` variable, which caused the Svelte render to throw after `loadAll()` completed and left the page frozen on the loading ellipsis;
  - the overview now uses the combined `secureSlotsUsed/secureSlotLimit` values, matching the resolver editor and documented shared DoT/DoH capacity.
- DNS `0.4.7-beta` completes documented DoH/plain-DNS parity in DNS Control:
  - Keenetic's documented secure-resolver capacity is treated as one combined pool of 8 physical DoT/DoH entries, so DoH and DoT cannot overcommit each other;
  - DoH domain bindings use the same logical-to-native expansion model as DoT; the editor projects the combined secure slot usage before save;
  - plain `ip name-server` keeps native multi-domain grouping but now enforces Keenetic's documented maximum of 16 domains per DNS server;
  - DoH format is limited to the documented `dnsm`/`json` values, and its effective port is derived from the HTTPS URL instead of a separate UI field;
  - regression tests cover mixed DoT/DoH 8-slot capacity, DoH multi-domain expansion, DoH URL-port semantics and the 16-domain plain-DNS limit.
- DNS `0.4.6-beta` fixes visual alignment inside the Module ABI iframe:
  - removes the erroneous second max-width/centering layer so DNS fills the full Core content column exactly like native pages;
  - copies Core's computed responsive UI tokens into the same-origin DNS iframe, so 2K/4K `auto` scaling matches the shell even though the iframe viewport is narrower after the persistent rail;
  - DNS typography, page padding, controls, tabs, cards, panels and modal now use the live Core scale variables instead of hard-coded 13px-era values.
- DNS `0.4.5-beta` visually aligns the Module ABI UI with the RouterForge Core shell:
  - the DNS iframe now uses the same 1440px centered page canvas, 20px page padding, header rhythm, typography, surfaces, borders and controls as Core monitoring pages;
  - DNS view tabs use the Core subtab language instead of a second pill-navigation system;
  - metric cards, panels, resolver cards, tables, state chips, buttons, notices and form controls now share Core density and spacing;
  - the duplicate resolver-page `+ Add DNS` action is removed; the global page action remains, while DoT slot usage moves into the resolver panel header;
  - the resolver editor is tightened to Core form dimensions and warning styling without changing mutation behavior.
- DNS `0.4.4-beta` adds a preflight guard for the Keenetic DoT capacity confirmed on live Hopper hardware:
  - Hopper accepts exactly 8 native DoT upstream entries; a 9th entry is silently truncated by NDMS.
  - RouterForge now rejects a mutation that would exceed 8 DoT physical entries before any native RCI write, returning a conflict instead of relying on rollback.
  - `/resolvers` exposes current DoT physical usage and the limit; the DNS UI shows `used/8`, projects the post-save usage, and disables Save when the requested logical resolver would exceed capacity.
  - Live validation confirmed 8/8 succeeds, 9/8 triggers readback rollback on `0.4.3-beta`, and cleanup restores the original native DNS snapshot byte-for-byte.
- DNS `0.4.3-beta` fixes Keenetic DoT SNI write/readback after live Hopper mutation testing:
  - structured RCI writes now translate RouterForge SNI to Keenetic's saved `fqdn` field, preventing NDMS from silently dropping SNI and triggering a readback rollback;
  - diagnostics no longer fabricate `SNI=<address>` for native DoT entries that have no SNI, and accept both `sni:` and `fqdn:` metadata labels.
  - the live failed mutation was fully rolled back and the native `/show/sc/dns-proxy` snapshot matched its pre-test SHA256 byte-for-byte.
- DNS `0.4.2-beta` polishes the Module ABI UI:
  - DNS tabs switch in-place without reloading the Core route/iframe, eliminating the visible page jump.
  - The resolver protocol selector uses RouterForge-owned dark styling and a consistent chevron instead of browser-native select chrome.
- DNS `0.4.1-beta` accepts both Keenetic RCI shapes for saved plain DNS (`[]` and `{"server":[...]}`), fixing resolver discovery on Hopper when no static plain DNS servers are configured.
  - DNS data-load errors no longer claim that the module itself is unavailable when its health endpoint is online.
- Core `0.4.1-beta` fixes the Module ABI v1 UI proxy: module directory URLs now preserve their trailing slash, so a module UI cannot escape from `/api/modules/<id>/ui/` into the Core SPA and render a nested RouterForge shell with a `404`.
  - `routerforge-dns` remains `0.4.0-beta`; this is a Core module-host fix, not a DNS module change.
- RouterForge `0.4.0-beta` introduces Module ABI v1 and turns DNS into a real independently versioned module:
  - Core keeps the web shell, auth, Marketplace/Registry and the generic module API/UI host; DNS capture, discovery, health, diagnostics and mutation logic move to the `routerforge-dns` runtime over a root-owned Unix socket.
  - `routerforge-dns` now ships `/opt/bin/routerforge-dns`, `S91routerforge-dns`, its own UI bundle and `/api/modules/dns/*`; future DNS-only changes no longer require rebuilding or version-bumping Core.
  - Legacy `/api/snapshot`, `/api/history`, `/api/plain-dns` and `/api/dns/info` remain compatibility bridges through Core during the 0.4 migration.
  - DNS Control adds resolver Add/Edit/Delete, temporary Disable/Enable, native multi-domain grouping, dynamic DHCP/service DNS read-only protection, structured Keenetic RCI writes, readback verification and rollback.
  - Resolver presentation uses RouterForge terminology: Overview, Resolvers, Rules, Traffic and Diagnostics. Physical ndnproxy entries remain available as advanced details instead of defining the normal UI.
  - Live Hopper findings are handled: same-address DoT resolvers remain distinct when SNI differs; Yandex `.ru/.su/.рф` entries group into one logical resolver; duplicate static A/AAAA records are collapsed independently of internal flags; policy names are enriched from Keenetic RCI when available.
- Canonical GitHub repository renamed to `Fifth-Ace/routerforge`; legacy links remain supported through redirects and the Core compatibility bridge.
- Monitoring cleanup for the next Beta:
  - Thermal collapses mirrored `thermal_zone` / `hwmon` sensors and adds human-readable MT7988 roles.
  - Storage hides internal flash block devices and duplicate mount aliases from the normal view while keeping raw data in Advanced mode.
  - Network uses active KeeneticOS logical interfaces, maps them to Linux `system-name` for counters, and keeps all kernel interfaces in Advanced mode.
  - Network interface and IPv4 route tables support click-to-sort columns with persistent direction during live refreshes.
- RU/EN localization is complete across the RouterForge frontend:
  - Home, Control, Marketplace, Settings, authentication, dialogs, redirects and every DNS subpage use the shared i18n dictionaries.
  - Browser titles, confirmations, empty states, alerts, tooltips/ARIA labels and frontend-rendered status text switch live with the selected language.
  - Locale-aware time, duration, relative-time and frontend status formatting now follows the current UI language.
  - Russian remains the default and fallback locale; technical IDs and user/Keenetic-provided data remain unchanged.
