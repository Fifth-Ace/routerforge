# Contributing to RouterForge

RouterForge targets Keenetic / Netcraze ARM64 routers running Entware.

## Branches

- `main` — production source for the RouterForge Stable channel.
- `dev` — active development and the rolling ARM64 Dev channel.
- feature/fix branches should normally target `dev`.

Beta is not published by every `dev` push. Beta publication is an explicit FULL RELEASE from a verified exact `dev` SHA.

A change reaches `main` only after it has passed CI and, when runtime behavior changes, has been validated on a test router.

## Local checks

Backend:

```sh
gofmt -w .
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

Frontend:

```sh
sh scripts/build-frontend.sh
sh scripts/build-dns-frontend.sh
sh scripts/build-admin-frontend.sh
sh scripts/build-monitoring-frontend.sh
```

Release tooling:

```sh
python3 -m py_compile \
  scripts/build_routerforge_channel.py \
  scripts/merge_release_index.py \
  scripts/render_release_notes.py \
  scripts/render_bootstrap.py
```

Shell:

```sh
sh -n scripts/install-repo.sh
sh -n scripts/remove-repo.sh
sh -n scripts/build-opkg.sh
sh -n scripts/build-admin-opkg.sh
sh -n scripts/build-module-opkg.sh
```

CI performs a broader package/container/runtime verification.

## Component versions

Official versions are declared independently:

```text
release/channels/dev.json
release/channels/beta.json
release/channels/stable.json
```

To release one component, bump only that component.

Do **not** bump Core just because an optional module changed.

CI preserves the previous release asset and SHA256 for any component whose version is unchanged.

## Release channels

- push to `dev` → mutable ARM64 `routerforge-dev`;
- explicit FULL RELEASE on an exact `dev` SHA → rolling `routerforge-beta` plus immutable versioned Beta snapshot;
- `main` → Stable promotion only from a validated promotion artifact for the exact source SHA.

Channel release-index is authoritative for exact version, asset, URL and SHA256.

Full release procedure and post-publication gates: [docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md](docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md).
Monitoring 4→1 migration contract and hardware gate: [docs/MONITORING_MIGRATION.md](docs/MONITORING_MIGRATION.md).

## App Center manifests

Do not turn Registry metadata into arbitrary shell execution.

Executable lifecycle must use supported typed methods and explicit package/path constraints.

Changes to approved manifests must change their manifest SHA and therefore require a new trust decision.

## Keenetic parsers

Keenetic/NDMS command output varies between firmware versions and hardware families.

Parsers should:

- tolerate missing fields;
- avoid hardcoding transient IDs when discovery is possible;
- fail visibly rather than silently inventing data;
- keep diagnostics safe for production routers.

## Runtime safety

Do not add:

- background benchmark workloads to monitoring;
- frequent persistent writes for high-rate telemetry;
- new LAN listeners for helper modules without a strong reason;
- broad `opkg upgrade` behavior;
- unauthenticated mutation endpoints.

## Bug reports

Include sanitized:

- router model;
- KeeneticOS/NDMS version;
- ARM64 confirmation;
- Stable/Beta channel;
- `routerforge-core` version;
- affected module versions;
- relevant RouterForge logs.

Never publish credentials, cookies, private keys, tunnel secrets, private infrastructure names, public IPs or MAC addresses.
